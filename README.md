### Thought Process and Coding Decisions ###

- I have created the frontend pages for the Login and Register. Since the password reset is not mentioned as a requirement, I may do that last. 
- I have decided to implement Zod + Vee-Validate for validation in the frontend. This should help in error handling and in error display. I have also installed a few tools to help with coding such as ESLint and Prettier to make the coding experience better.
